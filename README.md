This is an ongoing project I'm working on to practice applying object-oriented programming to machine learning primitive development. Right now, what I have is a 1 layer perceptron with an adjustable input dimension size. The output is the same size as the input to simplify the design. As the project progresses, I will be adding additional layers, the goal being to create a primitive that can be set to an arbitary depth. Stay tuned.
